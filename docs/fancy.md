Fancy is a URL shortner application where users can turn long ugly links (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_pv/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html) into shorter, more memorable links known as fancy links (fancy.nwie.net/AWSLambdaDocs).
<br />
<br />
<br />

![Url Shortener 6](/fancy/6-redirect-screen.png)
When fancy links are clicked the user first gets redirected to a splash page that markets the application, and then continues on to the link's final destination.

To create a link simply fill out the form. Once a link is created a green bar pops up to confirm a successful  create and the link is added to the table below.

Another feature of the application is a chart that displays usage over time. If the link is young the chart displays usage over days. When the link gets old enough the chart simplifies from days to months.

There is also a settings page where a fancy link's destination can be updated or the link can be deleted.
<br />
<br />
<br />

![Url Shortener 7](/fancy/7-usage.png)
This is a chart showing how often fancy links were used since the launch of Fancy v1. Screen shot was taken in January 2020. My version of Fancy launched in Q4 of 2017.
