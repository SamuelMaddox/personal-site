## TODO: Something about this stuff

Update Forbidden and Not Found Pages

Maybe this whole section should be placed at the top of the sample readme as a list of things to do. include items from the sample read found in section `## Notes For Designers`

Replace values in `./public/manifest.json` `./public/index.html` to reflect the app we're building. Also replace the logos & favicon images found in `./public`

`./public/index.html` needs title changed, and maybe a better fallback for `<noscript>`. Logos links need updated. meta description needs updated
